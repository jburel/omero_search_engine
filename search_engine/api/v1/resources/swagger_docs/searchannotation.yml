 API end point to search the annotation (key/value pair) for a resource (resource table, e.g. image, project, study, ..)
 the request data contation a dict (query) which contains the the query detatins.
 The query dict should has this format:
 q_data={"query":{'query_details':{"and_filters":and_filters,"or_filters":or_filters}}}
 each of and_filtersand or_filters is a list of dict whihc contains the search conditions, an example of and_filters is:
 and_filters=[{"Organism" : "Homo sapiens", "operator": "equals"},{"Gene Symbol": "NCAPD2", "operator": "equals"},{ "Cell Cycle Phase" :"anaphase", "operator": "equals"}]
 and_filters means that the results have to saitisy the conditions
 not_filters means that the results have not to the conditions
 or_filters means that the results should satsify at least one condition inside the filters

 Example:
   {

         "query_details": {
         "and_filters": [
           {
             "name": "Gene Symbol",
             "value": "pdx1",
             "operator": "equals",
             "resource": "image"
           }
         ],
         "or_filters": [

         ],
         "case_sensitive": false
       },
         "mode": "usesearchterms"
       }
